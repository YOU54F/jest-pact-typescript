#### Example requests

Pact contract test 1 - Happy Path, send a valid request and expect a valid response

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"last_name":"happyPath"}'
```

Expected and actual response below

```sh
{
    "testResult": "validRequest"
}
```

Pact contract test 2 - Unhappy Path, send an invalid request (empty required field) and expect an error

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"last_name":""}'

```

Expected and actual response below

```sh
{
    "errors": [
        "An error occurred"
    ]
}
```

Pact Stub Server Test 3 - Dev Functionality Test - An empty post request should return a 404

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

```

Expected Result = Returns an empty response body and a 404
Actual Result = Returns the below body and a 200

```sh
{
    "testResult": "validRequest"
}
```

Pact Stub Server Test 4 - Dev Functionality Test - An post request with a field not specified in the providers request body should return a 404

```sh

curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "unknownData": "validRequest"
  }'
```

Expected Result = Returns an empty response body and a 404
Actual Result = Returns an empty response body and a 404

## TODO

- Investigate why pact-foundation/pact-stub-server is returning a response from the pact contract, where no body has been provided in the request.
- Pact stub server is returning this in the logs `[WARN] Found more than one pact request for method POST and path '/test', using the first one`
